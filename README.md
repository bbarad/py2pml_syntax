py2pml_syntax
=============

Syntax highlighting for py2pml files (my term for python files which output pml).

##Installation
Copy the `py2pml.tmLanguage` file to your sublime text user packages folder.

##Requirements
You must have installed the [pymol syntax](https://github.com/bbarad/pymol_syntax) for this to work.
Name your file with the ending `.py2pml` for it to be highlighted automatically.
